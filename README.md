# Inspired GitHub Color Scheme

Inspired GitHub is a color scheme for Sublime Text 3. It is, obviously, heavily _inspired_ by the syntax highlighting found on GitHub, and not an exact representation. For readability, I've slightly cut down on the amount of color in the highlighting and I've introduced bolding for certain things, such as keywords.
